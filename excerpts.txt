bank 4 - audio?

0:5194 - increases bombs function


# ------ room loading
Call_000_1909
- looks in structure 74a1 for word (offset $12) $7bcb
- loads $3d23 into ec (immediately put into $c038/9)
as part of TODOloads... function, this goes into general-purpose wram $c006/7
which is then used as part of the decompression algo in common.s


# ------ constants
0:4ea6 - transitioning up - c=3
0:4ee2 - transitioning down - c=6
0:4ef9 - transitioning to left screen - c=9
0:4f0f - transitioning right


# ------- room structs
byte 2 lower nybble x2 - tileset idx

byte 1 - read and move on - stored in c72b
if byte 1 bit 7 set - read next 2 bytes
if byte 1 bit 6 set - read next 2 bytes
if byte 1 bit 2 set - read next byte
byte 2 - read and move on - stored in c72c
if byte 2 bit 5 set - read next 4 bytes
next 2 bytes is address of tiles to decompress

group00room0estruct:
	.db $10
	.db $00
	.dw group00room0elayout
	.db $55 $8c $09 $00 $02 $10 $80 $ff $04 $83 $66 $ff
after the 1st $ff, $04 $83 $66 $ff
$04 - could be npc idx
$83 - the 3 could be direction?
$66 - upper nybble is x, lower nybble is y


# ------- text
text - debug c062/3 word written $640e
bank 1 code - deals with room flags/alterations


# ------- room generation duplicates
repeated car gfx - group 2
repeated forest cave gfx - group d
repeated wall enclosure - group 15
check ignored on 1b to 1e
